   Development Toolchain for Rigol Oscilloscopes

   This toolchain makes it possible to compile and link your own software against
   the Rigol firmware. You can upload and run it on your device or implant it to a 
   firmware image. Actually, only blackfin assembly is supported, but i plan to supply 
   c-header files with wrappers around the firmware calls.

Supported Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Actually we only patch firmware version 02.05.02.00. You need a suitable
   firmware update file for this version.


Supported Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Rigol DS1052E/DS1052D, HW v58 and lower
   - Rigol DS1102E/DS1102D, HW v58 and lower

   - Other Hardware is untested, but when original firmware version 02.05.02.00 
     is working, the patched one will working too.


Compile/Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
    install git if needed:

	sudo apt-get install git    

    To get the latest version of the toolchain, simply checkout the appropriate git repository with the line:

	git clone git://github.com/krater/rigol-toolchain.git
 
    Switch to the resulting directory:

	cd rigol-toolchain

    Execute the install script, this will install all required packages and install the tool chain on your system:

	./install.sh

    
    2)Patching the firmware

      You need a firmware image (DS1000EUpdate.RGL) version 02.05.02.00 
      with a md5sum of 9c28690d8d5a5690b7340fda943f5549.

      The md5sum of the firmware can be verified with the command:
	md5sum -b DS1000EUpdate.RGL

      Copy your firmware image to examples/rwpatch/DS1000EUpdate.RGL,
      switch to this directory and do a
   
      make patch

      When you get the Message "Firmware ready to flash.", you can copy the resulting firmware 
      image to a USB stick and flash it to you oscilloscope.
      
      !!! Make sure your oscillsocope will work with version 02.05.02.00 of the firmware !!!
      !!!                          BEFORE you flash the image                            !!!


    3)Building and uploading the Samples
      
      First you should connect your PC and the Oscilloscope through a RS-232 cable. Then
      switch to the appropriate directory and write your used tty device name to the Makefile.

      Type:

      make         # for build your application
      make upload  # for uploading it to the ram of your Rigol device
      make start   # to start it
 

    4)Have fun !

Bugs/Todo
~~~~~~~~~

   Development:
     - Add wrappers around the internal Rigol functions to use it with
       GNU C compiler
     - Write firmware patcher and header files for oher firmware versions
     - Write a nicer Makefile
     - ...
   
   Reverse engineering:
     - Find a way to access the measured values 
     - Access the speaker and button led's
     - ...

    Help is welcome :)
