   Development Toolchain for Rigol Oscilloscopes

   This toolchain makes it possible to compile and link your own software against
   the Rigol firmware, then you can upload and run it on a device with a patched 
   firmware. In a future release, i plan to supply c header files with wrappers 
   around the firmware calls. Up to that point, you must use blackfin assembly 
   to write your own code.

Supported Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Actually we only patch firmware version 02.05.02.00. You need a suitable
   firmware update file for this version.


Supported Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Rigol DS1052E/DS1052D, HW v58 and lower
   - Rigol DS1102E/DS1102D, HW v58 and lower

   - Other Hardware is untested, but when original firmware version 02.05.02.00 
     is working, the patched one will working too.


Bugs/Todo
~~~~~~~~~

   Development:
     - Add wrappers around the internal Rigol functions to use it with
       GNU C compiler
     - Write firmware patcher and header files for oher firmware versions
     - Write a nicer Makefile
     - ...
   
   Reverse engineering:
     - Find a way to access the measured values 
     - Access the speaker and button led's
     - ...

    Help is welcome :)
